# Deep Learning with Python

## About

This project showcases the process of building a machine learning model on the IMDB dataset from Keras, with reference to the universal workflow shown in [Deep Learning with Python 4.5 (1st Edition)](https://tanthiamhuat.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/deeplearningwithpython.pdf). Different techniques such as increasing/reducing capacity, L1 and L2 regularisation, and adding dropout were applied to the model to find the best model with the highest accuracy. Full documentation of the steps can be found in [deepLearningWithPython.ipynb](https://github.com/chengjingling/deepLearningWithPython/blob/main/deepLearningWithPython.ipynb).
